### Welcome to Joshua Caratao's Profile! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a Mechanical Engineering Student at the University of Texas at Austin. 

From my experience, I've developed a deep interest in both mechanical design and programming. I love being able to design things while also being able to have the skills to bring those things to life through electronics and programming.

Currently, I'm interested in robotics, aerospace, and defense.

Feel free to view my public repos to see what electronics/programming projects I've worked on!
